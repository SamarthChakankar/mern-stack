        you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user
        interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little,
        do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website
        attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site
        is to master the art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy
        as it seems!

        However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help
        you get better in front-end design and web development.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><h4>Commenting</h4></li>

        <p>
          Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers,
          especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. But
          remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. With
          proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or
          others to jump in and understand where things are at and how they
          work.
        </p>

        <li><h4>Invest In Productive Tools.</h4></li>

        <p>
          The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from
          browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices available now
          is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web tools
          that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like
          Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub, Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing
          short of a godsend for web developers.
        </p>

        <li><h4>Always Be Curious.</h4></li>

        <p>
          A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously
          with the latest news and innovations in the field. You need to take a
          proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development from
          informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most
          informative and useful learning sources for front-end developers -
        </p>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These
          meet-ups provide excellent opportunities to expand your network and
          get acquainted with talented people.
        </p>

        <li><h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h4></li>

        <p>
          By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without
          tampering with its functionality. This will improve the quality and
          readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your
          code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of
          what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant
          advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code
          remains free from plagiarism.
        </p>

        <li><h4>Automate!</h4></li>

        <p>
          As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute
          little details that can get overwhelming at times. You have to invest
          your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency
          management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on.
          Doesn’t sound easy, right?
        </p>

        <p>
          Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your
          workflow. While automation can take care of things such as
          optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
          front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side
          software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not
          only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use
          your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall
          functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very
          efficient automation tools.
        </p>
      </ol>

      <p>
        While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end
        designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things while
        designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to
        create your signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making
        it big in front-end development.
